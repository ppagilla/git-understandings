
observations:
trying to revert the reverted 8 commit.
so in 8th commit we have added line8, so reverting will be file containing 7 lines, Now reverting this means adding 8th line. ==> case if 9th commit is not there or straight away if we revert the original 8th commit(so file will be updated like the 8 lines of plain file.)

but, just before reverting 8th commit, we have commited 9th. so now the file will be like the content capture in 9th commit also.
(it will be like all lines and line 9 with additional data, and line7 with additional data)
